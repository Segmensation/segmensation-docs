Predict Classes
===============
TODO: The Random Forest Classifier(or Hough Circle Transformation) that was created during Training can be used to predict the contents of other images.
For this, select another image from the upload section and run the Prediction.
Resulting probability maps can be saved as images and pixel probabilities can be saved as CSV.
