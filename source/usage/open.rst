Uploading an Image
==================

Segmensation can handle standard Images (.jpg, .png) as well as 
large, multidimensional Images (.czi, .tif).

Standard Images can simply be uploaded by clicking the corresponding 
field and selecting an image from the file system.

For the correct upload of multidimensional images additional 
information is necessary:

**Channel**
	The channel that should be uploaded. 
**Images (from/to)**
	The range of single images/layers that should be uploaded.
**File Type**
	Defines if the image should be handled as a layered image (CZI 
	Stack) or a mosaic (CZI Stitching).

When the upload is completed, the corresponding image is shown on 
the left and can be selected for further processing.
